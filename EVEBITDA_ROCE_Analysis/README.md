# EV/EBITDA vs ROCE – Sector-wise Valuation Analysis

This project explores how **capital efficiency (ROCE)** aligns with **market valuation multiples (EV/EBITDA)** across different sectors in India.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To analyze sector-wise differences in operational efficiency and how investors value them using EV/EBITDA multiples.

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Collection:**  
   - Extracted company-level financial data for major Indian sectors.
2. **Normalization:**  
   - Adjusted values for consistency and comparability.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Computed sectoral averages and correlation metrics.
4. **Visualization:**  
   - Created sector-level scatter plots to observe value vs efficiency clusters.
